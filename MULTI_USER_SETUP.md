# Multi-User Authentication Setup for PSX Chainlit Application

## 🎯 Overview

Your Chainlit application has been successfully upgraded to support multiple user authentication! You now have **10 user accounts** with different roles and secure password hashing.

## 📋 What Was Created

### 1. User Accounts (10 total)
- **2 Financial Analysts** (`analyst1`, `analyst2`) - Full export permissions
- **2 Portfolio Managers** (`manager1`, `manager2`) - Full export permissions  
- **2 Research Associates** (`researcher1`, `researcher2`) - Read/analyze only
- **2 Trading Specialists** (`trader1`, `trader2`) - Read/analyze only
- **1 Risk Analyst** (`risk_analyst`) - Full export permissions
- **1 Compliance Officer** (`compliance`) - Read/analyze only

### 2. Enhanced Authentication System
- **Database-based authentication** with secure password hashing (PBKDF2 + SHA256)
- **Role-based permissions** system
- **Fallback admin authentication** (your original env variable method still works)
- **User metadata** including roles, names, and permissions

### 3. Generated Files
- `insert_users.sql` - SQL script to add users to your database
- `user_credentials.txt` - Login credentials for all users
- `enhanced_auth.py` - Enhanced authentication module
- `setup_users.py` - Script used to generate users

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Users to Database

Run the SQL script against your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Option 1: Using psql command line
psql -d your_database_name -f insert_users.sql

# Option 2: Copy/paste the SQL content into your database management tool
# (like pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Verify Authentication Files

Ensure these files are in your project directory:
- `enhanced_auth.py` ✅ (created)
- Updated `Step8MCPClientPsxGPT.py` ✅ (modified)

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **Start your Chainlit application** as usual
2. **Try logging in** with any of the new user credentials
3. **Verify the admin fallback** still works with your original credentials

## 🔑 User Credentials

```
Username        Password        Role         Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------
analyst1        QkFxpWJ0p6^$    analyst      Financial Analyst 1
analyst2        gPt4yWIdgExI    analyst      Financial Analyst 2
manager1        XOOG4zY&pjcZ    manager      Portfolio Manager 1
manager2        e66yGcX19qth    manager      Portfolio Manager 2
researcher1     8&cChenC!gRZ    researcher   Research Associate 1
researcher2     vA$VwV20utgd    researcher   Research Associate 2
trader1         ijbMD%To5FVh    trader       Trading Specialist 1
trader2         &Cc$EzRGob%R    trader       Trading Specialist 2
risk_analyst    1I&@1o9%Nejh    risk_analyst Risk Analyst
compliance      2SLztWGeLUa#    compliance   Compliance Officer
```

⚠️ **Important**: Change these passwords after first login for security!

## 🔒 Security Features

### Password Security
- **PBKDF2 hashing** with SHA256 (100,000 iterations)
- **Unique salt** for each password
- **Secure random passwords** (12 characters, mixed case + symbols)

### Role-Based Permissions
- **Read**: All users can view financial data
- **Analyze**: All users can perform analysis
- **Export**: Only managers, analysts, and risk analysts can export data

### Authentication Flow
1. **Database check first** - Validates against User table
2. **Admin fallback** - Your original env variable method still works
3. **Enhanced metadata** - User roles, permissions, and session info

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Authentication Process
1. User enters username/password in Chainlit login
2. System checks database User table for matching username
3. Password is hashed and compared with stored hash
4. If match found, user is authenticated with their role/permissions
5. If no database match, falls back to admin env variables
6. User session includes role, permissions, and metadata

### Database Integration
- Uses your existing PostgreSQL database and User table
- Stores password hashes and user metadata in JSONB format
- Integrates with Chainlit's built-in authentication system

## 📊 User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Description | Read | Analyze | Export |
|------|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| `analyst` | Financial Analysts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `manager` | Portfolio Managers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `researcher` | Research Associates | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `trader` | Trading Specialists | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `risk_analyst` | Risk Analyst | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `compliance` | Compliance Officer | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `admin` | Admin (env variables) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Authentication failed" errors**
- Verify the SQL script was run successfully
- Check that DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
- Confirm user exists in database: `SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE identifier = 'username';`

**2. Admin login stopped working**
- Admin env variables still work as fallback
- Check ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD are set in your .env file

**3. Database connection issues**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
- Test database connectivity
- Check firewall/network settings

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check if users were created
SELECT identifier, metadata->>'role', metadata->>'name' FROM "User";

-- Count users by role
SELECT metadata->>'role' as role, COUNT(*) FROM "User" GROUP BY metadata->>'role';

-- Verify user permissions
SELECT identifier, metadata->'permissions' FROM "User";
```

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Share credentials** with your team members
2. **Test different user roles** to verify permissions work correctly
3. **Consider password rotation** policy for security
4. **Monitor user activity** through Chainlit's built-in logging
5. **Add more users** as needed using the same pattern

## 🔄 Adding More Users

To add additional users in the future:

1. Run `python3 setup_users.py` again (modify the users_data list first)
2. Or manually create users using the same SQL pattern
3. Or build a user management interface

## ✅ Success!

Your PSX Chainlit application now supports:
- ✅ **10 user accounts** with different roles
- ✅ **Secure password authentication**
- ✅ **Role-based permissions**
- ✅ **Database integration**
- ✅ **Admin fallback** for backwards compatibility

Your team can now access the financial analysis system with their individual accounts!
